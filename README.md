react-spinkit
=============

A collection of loading indicators animated with CSS for React

Currently I've ported all the spinner animations from
[Spinkit](https://github.com/tobiasahlin/SpinKit). If you have other favorite
 css spinner you'd like to include, open an issue.

## CSS
If you use [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) and the
[css-loader](https://github.com/webpack/css-loader) to build your project, then the
css for each spinner is automatically required (by adding `cssRequire` as a prop).

Otherwise, you'll need to include the necessary css for each spinner you
use from `/css`.
