react-spinkit
=============

A collection of loading indicators animated with CSS for React

Currently I've transcribed one spinner animation from
[Spinkit](https://github.com/tobiasahlin/SpinKit) with more to follow!
Pull requests welcome if your favorite spinner isn't included. And despite the name, I'm welcome to adding other classy css spinners not from Spinkit.

You're currently required to use [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) to build your project
as this component takes advantage of [Webpack's css
loader](https://github.com/webpack/css-loader).
