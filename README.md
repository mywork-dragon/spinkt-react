react-spinkit
=============

A collection of loading indicators animated with CSS for React

Currently I've transcribed one spinner animation from
[Spinkit](https://github.com/tobiasahlin/SpinKit) with more to follow!
Pull request welcome if you're favorite spinner isn't included.

You're currently required to use [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) to build your project
as this component takes advantage of [Webpack's css
loader](https://github.com/webpack/css-loader).
